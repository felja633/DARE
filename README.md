# DARE
This repository contains a python implementation of the Density Adaptive Point Set Registration (DARE) method. Without the density adaptation, the method is equivalent to Joint Registration of Multiple Point Sets (JRMPC) [1]. Additionally, implementations of Color-based Probabilistic Point Set Registration (CPPSR) [2] and Feature-based Probabilistic Point Set Registration (FPPSR) [3] are provided and can be run together with the density adaptation. 

The script reg_demo.py runs DARE on a subsampled version of the vps outdoor dataset. 

This method is also included in <https://github.com/felja633/RLLReg> as a pytorch implementation.

## Publication
A detailed description of the DARE method can be found in the CVPR 2018 paper:

## Dependencies
* python 3.6
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* pathlib
* cmake
* pcl (if you want to use FPPSR)

## Installation
Make sure that the above dependencies are installed. 
 
* To be able to run FPPSR, you need to build the pybind module in src/pcl_utils at src/pcl_utils/build. 

You may use the shell script build_pybind_modules. The code has been tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.

## Datasets
